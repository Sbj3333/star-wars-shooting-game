# star-wars-shooting-game
This is a simple shooting game which does not use any fancy graphics, but uses simple code. The turtle module is used. You can refer to the turtle module documentation.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html - here you can see what all functions are there in the turtle module and what are their syntaxes and how to use them.
Basically there is a gun/spaceship in the centre of the screen. There are bullets already loaded inside the gun. There are asteroids i.e obstacles which are formed at random postions and head towards the player(gun). The player can control the gun and shoot bullets using the Left/Right arrow keys and spacebar respectively.
Have fun playing the game.
